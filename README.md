Case: Logistics Optimization
Your client is a fast-growing company selling widgets across the continental US. The consulting team believes that as the company expands, they may benefit from moving from a single distribution warehouse (currently in Syracuse NY) to multiple distribution points. Their sales are growing at a rate of 15% a year so their spend with their parcel service is exploding. They do not know yet if this is the case – that is where you come in!
You know a few things:
1) The company pays the following rates:
a. $5.60/package for shipments < 500 miles
b. $8.70/package for shipments < 1250 miles
c. $11.90/package for shipments > 1250 US within the continental US
d. $18.00/package for shipments requiring air freight
2) The company ships packages in equivalent size and weight (you may assume all packages have the same price)
3) Shipments also have surcharges – the client has very little visibility into how the reasons for these so they cannot share any information with you.
4) Their current warehousing spend is $150K a year.
The client has provided their current demand data – which includes destination & origin points. Your task is to create an initial analytic output to share with the client.
Your goal
1) Prepare & present analysis to the client detailing what savings opportunities you see based on the data they have provided – recommendations & findings.
2) Build a business case for what kind of analysis they need as part of a cohesive strategy. Is there anything you can build to help them? What is it? What value will it bring their business?
Some tips for the submission:
1) Their current vendor is not very cooperative because they sense you may be looking for cost avoidance opportunities – so the data they have provided is sparse. Work with what you have and make sure to document the assumptions you make.
2) The final output is a client presentation, so include minimum 3 slides. These need to be able to stand alone & should be organized to resonate with client stakeholders.
3) Submit any analysis you create. This includes spreadsheets, code, notes, etc.
a. Code can be in any language – just pick what you are most comfortable with &
include detailed comments.
